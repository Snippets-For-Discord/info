# Snippets for Discord
Some handy CSS/SCSS snippets for Discord client mods, such as:
- **[Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)**, which is available on **[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)** / **[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)** / **[Opera](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Opera,-Outdated-Stylus)**
- **[BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/)**
- **[Powercord](https://powercord.dev/)**
- **[Vizality](https://vizality.com/)** 
- **[Goosemod](https://goosemod.com/)**

# How does this work?
Most snippets can be applied to themes or a user can take them as is, but some, such as [Theme Warnings](https://github.com/Snippets-For-Discord/theme-warnings) is strictly for themes as they help enhance it. 
- We also recommend using snippets by taking the code instead of importing them from the githubusercontent / githack url, as they are fairly customizable as well as it's just generally better to do period.
There are also SCSS versions of the snippets, not just CSS, so if SCSS is your style feel free to use those instead!

# Suggestions / Issues
If you have a snippet suggestion, make an issue request on this repo, following the format so it's easier on us to add the snippet. If you run into an issue with a snippet, such as something not working properly, make an issue request on the snippet's specific repo, not this one. If you're able to fix it, then feel free to make a pull request doing so!
